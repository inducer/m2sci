Restrictions on the matlab language that matlab2scilab understands:
- Must have semicolons in all vector literals.
- Scripting command support is limited.
  (for example: "hold off")
- Distinguishing complex transpose operators from string literals can be hard.
  Instead of
    eu(ll,jj,ki) = ev(:,jj)'*exp(i*2*pi*(kv(ki)+(-L:L)')*xv(ll));
  you should write
    eu(ll,jj,ki) = ev(:,jj)'...
	      *exp(i*2*pi*(kv(ki)+(-L:L)')*xv(ll));
  to avoid  having two single quotes on one line.
